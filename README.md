An organization has collected data from individuals seeking their services related to mental health support. The data is in xlxs format with 2 sheets (check file preview and description in the repository). This project will consist of conducting a light EDA (i.e. Exploratory Analysis), and joining data from sheets as necessary to answer raised questions.
