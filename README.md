# Embr. test data
An organization has collected data from individuals seeking their services related to mental health support. The data is in xlxs format with 2 sheets (check file preview and description in the repository). This project will consist of conducting a light EDA (i.e. Exploratory Analysis), and joining data from sheets as necessary to answer raised questions. 

## Questions 

#### Question 1
what percentages of "seen" (i.e. completed) appointments were in March for minors seen by psychatrists?
Answer: An approximate 3% of the total sample (patients who attended) represents minors (i.e. The legislative texts in Lebanon are in conformity with the stipulation of article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in which a child is defined as every human being below the age of 18) - more details in Questions_Answers.ipynb notebook in the repository.

#### Question 2
For patients who attended more than 1 session, what was the average percentage change in phq9 scores? is there a difference in percentages variation between patients who saw 1 type of practitioner and those who did not?

Answer: The average percentage change for the sample (patients who attented more than once) is with a 95% confidence at a 47% average between 47.34 and 47.73 - more details in Questions_Answers.ipynb notebook in the repository.
